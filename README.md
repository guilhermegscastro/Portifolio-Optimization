<h1>Portfolio Optimization Case Study</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
In this case study, we explore the construction and optimization of investment portfolios using stocks and ETFs. The goal is to demonstrate the process of creating a portfolio with equal weighting and another portfolio optimized for the best return adjusted for risk. This project involves the following steps:

- <b>Data Import: Importing five years of historical data for 15 stocks and ETFs from the NASDAQ database. </b>

<br />
- <b>Initial Portfolio Construction: Building an initial portfolio with equal weighting for each of the 15 stocks. </b>
- <b>Analysis and Visualization: Analyzing and visualizing the performance of the equal-weighted portfolio. </b>
- <b>Scenario Generation: Generating 10,000 portfolio scenarios with random weightings for each stock. </b>
- <b>Optimization: Identifying the optimal portfolio from the generated scenarios and visualizing the results. </b>

<h2>Key Components</h2>

- <b>Data Handling: The project utilizes historical stock price data, focusing on the adjusted closing prices for analysis. </b>
- <b>Equal-Weighted Portfolio: The initial portfolio is constructed with equal allocation to each stock, serving as a baseline for comparison. </b>
- <b>Scenario Analysis: Using Monte Carlo simulation, 10,000 different portfolio weight combinations are generated to explore a wide range of potential outcomes. </b>
- <b>Optimization Technique: The project employs optimization techniques to identify the portfolio with the best risk-adjusted return. </b>
- <b>Visualization: Comprehensive visualizations are created to illustrate the performance and characteristics of both the equal-weighted and optimized portfolios.</b>

<h2>Project Structure</h2>

- <b>Import Packages & Data: The initial setup, including the import of necessary Python packages and data. </b>
- <b>Data Processing: Steps to clean and prepare the data for analysis. </b>
- <b>Portfolio Construction: Building the equal-weighted portfolio. </b>
- <b>Scenario Generation and Optimization: Generating random portfolios and optimizing for the best return adjusted for risk. </b>
- <b>Results Visualization: Graphical representation of the portfolio performances and optimization results.</b>

<h2>How to Use </h2>

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following packages:
- <b>Pandas </b> 
- <b>numpy </b>
- <b>seaborn </b>
- <b>matplotlib </b>

You can execute the Jupyter notebook step by step to see the data import, processing, portfolio construction, scenario generation, optimization, and visualization processes in action.

<h2>Purpose and Conclusion </h2>
This project provides a comprehensive demonstration of portfolio optimization, showcasing the steps from data import and processing to scenario analysis and optimization. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding the intricacies of portfolio management and optimization techniques in the financial services industry. THIS ANALYSIS ALONE CANNOT BE USED BY FINANCIAL ANALYSTS, INVESTORS, AND DECISION-MAKERS TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT DECISION.
